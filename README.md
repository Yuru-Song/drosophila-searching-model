# drosophila-searching-model
I was trying to build a model that could describe the male Drosophila's position during searching for a female. 
It uses very basic assumptions that the fly is doing Brownian random walk and suddenly comes across its target.
But the truth is far more complicated than this cute litte assumption.

The codes are writen for numerical calculations.

I might come back and think about this problem one day.
